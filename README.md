[Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn) --- ([repo](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/) [pdf](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/blob/master/milestone_6.pdf)) --- This extension of the research conducted by Yusaku Horiuchi, Daniel Smith, and Teppei Yamamoto (2020) looks at the gap between the experimental results and actual observational data of candidate attributes who were elected.

[Drake Deuel](https://github.com/ddeuel) --- ([repo](https://github.com/ddeuel/Bikeshare-Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/davidkane9/gov_1006_spring_2020_papers/papers/bikeshare_deuel.pdf)) --- "This is an extension and replication of the research done by Fullter et al. (2019) which used the Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7, 2016, to generate a natural experiment in which other means of transit were interrupted to study the impact on bikeshare ride usage."

[Diego Martinez](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221) --- ([repo](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221/gov_1006_replication)) This is an extension of "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots" by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. They seek to understand why politicians with local roots have more successs by testing how this effect holds up when voters are treated with the candidate's behavioral information. They concluded that with more infomation, the local roots effect does diminish; however, it is still positve. Furthermore, voters had a marginally higher preference for candidates with local roots compared to other varying characterstics including gender, party, and policy interests.

[Robert McKenzie](https://github.com/rmckenzie11) --- ([repo](https://github.com/rmckenzie11/Replication_1006)) --- "This extension of research conducted by Ernesto Calvo and Jonathan Rodden (2015) on the relationship between geographic distribution and electoral representation in multi-party democracies, specifically the UK, tests the MC Model they built on different election datasets. The extension will test the model on data from electoral systems with similar party groupings as their training data (Canada) and radically different party groupings (India)."

[Daniel Shapiro](https://github.com/dfshapir) --- ([repo](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication) [pdf](https://github.com/dfshapir/Replication/blob/master/Shapiro_Chechnya.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Laws In Conflict: Legacies of War, Gender, and Legal Pluralism in Chechnya" written by Egor Lazarev. The paper utilizes data collected by the author in the Russian regions of Chechnya and Ingushetia to analyze how various factors affected residents' choice of either Russian law courts, sharia courts, or customary (adat) arbitration in family-related cases. The author finds that women are significantly more likely to choose Russian state law than men, a finding that a) the author argues is unique to Chechnya due to the republic's violent recent history and b) I was able to replicate. My extension focuses on some of Lazarev's political and sociological analyses of Chechnya and Ingushetia and some of his data choices as well.

[Cian Stryker](https://github.com/CianStryker) --- ([repo](https://github.com/CianStryker/Prosocial_Behavior) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Cian_Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. Using survey data from Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that includes 1200 responses, this paper explores the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out-group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior towards both the in and out-groups.

(2018) on mass shooting intervals looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since their publication. Specifically, the update uses the regressions created to compare the expected intervals in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented.
