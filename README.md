[Evelyn Cai](https://github.com/caievelyn) --- ([repo](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/) [pdf](https://github.com/caievelyn/milestone/blob/master/milestone_6.pdf)) --- This extension of the research conducted by Yusaku Horiuchi, Daniel Smith, and Teppei Yamamoto (2020) looks at the gap between the experimental results and actual observational data of candidate attributes who were elected.

[Molly Chiang](https://github.com/mollyechiang) --- ([repo](https://github.com/mollyechiang/1006_milestone_6)) --- This is an extension of Marshall (2015), which shows the causal effect of additional years of schooling on voting conservative via regression discontinuty analysis on voting records of individuals before and after the British 1947 school-leaving age reform. This extension aims to see if the same effect is found in an analysis of a later education reform in England.

(2019) which used the Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7, 2016, to generate a natural experiment in which other means of transit were interrupted to study the impact on bikeshare ride usage."

This extension of the research done by Pan (2017) on the signalling function of local government websites in China explores whether other explanations than the signalling function within authoritarian regimes may plosibly exlain the alterations in competence / benevolence patterns described in the paper. I will explore these alternatives by comparing the explanatory power of the variable categories employed in the paper and extending them with a new category (culture which will include the macro-region and the county type). Building on this, the other part of my extension will be around validating the sample selection process. It seems very surprising that the author has sub-selected 100 of the 2,787 counties with website, and we immediately dismiss another ~30 in our regressions because of data inavailability and subsequently another ~20 as our regressions get more ambitious and include more variables.

[Diego Martinez](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221) --- ([repo](https://github.com/diegomartinez1221/gov_1006_replication)) This is an extension of "Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots" by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, Markus Wagner. They seek to understand why politicians with local roots have more successs by testing how this effect holds up when voters are treated with the candidate's behavioral information. They concluded that with more infomation, the local roots effect does diminish; however, it is still positve. Furthermore, voters had a marginally higher preference for candidates with local roots compared to other varying characterstics including gender, party, and policy interests.

[Robert McKenzie](https://github.com/rmckenzie11) --- ([repo](https://github.com/rmckenzie11/Replication_1006)) --- "This extension of research conducted by Ernesto Calvo and Jonathan Rodden (2015) on the relationship between geographic distribution and electoral representation in multi-party democracies, specifically the UK, tests the MC Model they built on different election datasets. The extension will test the model on data from electoral systems with similar party groupings as their training data (Canada) and radically different party groupings (India)."

Their analysis is done by combining government data on the locations of legalized plots of land with a range of geographical data, including remote sensing imagery. After matching treated plots with untreated ones, they find no significant treatment affect on deforestation rates. 

[Cian Stryker](https://github.com/CianStryker) --- ([repo](https://github.com/CianStryker/Prosocial_Behavior) [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/Cian_Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf)) --- This is an extension and replication of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. Using survey data from Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that includes 1200 responses, this paper explores the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out-group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior towards both the in and out-groups.

(2018) on mass shooting intervals looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since their publication. Specifically, the update uses the regressions created to compare the expected intervals in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented.

[Amanda Su](https://github.com/amanda-y-su) --- ([repo](https://github.com/amanda-y-su/race-writing-computation)) --- [pdf](https://github.com/GOV-1006-Spring-2020/papers/blob/master/papers/su_race_computation.pdf)) This is a replication and extension of the paper "Race, Writing, and Computation: Racial Difference and the US Novel, 1880-2000" writtten by Richard Jean So, Hoyt Long, and Yuancheng Zhu. The authors seek to explore how computation can present new opportunities for thinking about racial difference and its patterns and regularities at scale. They test if American novelists marked as “white” versus “black” produce different narratological effects with respect to the interaction of race and religious authority, in particular, the authority of the Bible. In simpler terms, do writers identified as racially different contextualize the Bible in different ways in their novels?
